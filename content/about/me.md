This is a personal travel blog website currently in development. The blog is not meant to be a source of travel advice. Instead, here I record stories of my travels along with saves some of my favorite photos and memories all for sharing with family and friends.

### Credits

A high-content, fast-moving tour inevitably looses some photo ops along the way. In cases where I couldn't capture _my_ view of the site/scene, I have sometimes downloaded from others who have shared on the internet. I have attempted to make every borrowed photo clear by attribution of the artist.

The basic theme was cloned as credited in the footnotes. My modifications are also available through the MIT license.
