This is a personal travel blog website currently in development. The blog is not meant to be a source of travel advice. Instead, here I record stories of my travels along with saves some of my favorite photos and memories all for sharing with family and friends.

### Credits

A high-content, fast-moving tour inevitably looses some photo ops along the way. In cases where I couldn't capture _my view_ of the site/scene, I have downloaded from others who have shared on the internet. I  attempted to attribute every borrowed photo by attribution of the artist in the text, caption or a link.

The basic theme was cloned from [HUGO theme dream](https://github.com/g1eny0ung/hugo-theme-dream) as credited in the website footer. The original theme and my modifications are also available through the MIT license.
