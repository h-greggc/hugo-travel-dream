Barcelona is a vibrant city known for its rich history, stunning architecture, and lively culture. It is home to numerous world-class museums, including the Picasso Museum and the Joan Miró Foundation, showcasing the works of these renowned artists. The city's historic center, with its Gothic Quarter, features narrow medieval streets, charming squares, and impressive landmarks such as the Barcelona Cathedral and the Plaça del Rei.

## A Traveler's Rule: Don't Nap

Travelers arriving from the US are likely to arrive on overnight flights to European destinations on the morning of their first tour day. Tour guides tell you that napping away the remainder of the first day never hastens the adjustment to a new time-zone. Therefore, just drop your bags at the hotel and head right out for some local sites and sounds in the daylight! Jet lag will disappear...eventually. So after meeting our tour manager, we checked our bags, grabbed a map and a little advice before heading out into downtown Barcelona. (The location of our hotel, [H10 Casanova](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9KdhMajapr1dNEm86), is shown on the embedded Googlemap.)

## Barcelona in the "high season"

Rebecca and I expected no real challenges for our _unguided_ Barcelona afternoon. I had been in Barcelona a dozen years before, bust things change slowly in Europe so it was the same in appearances and feel. Earlier in the day I had  secured reservations for the [Pablo Picasso museum](https://museupicassobcn.cat/en), so that was our target: the answer to,  "what's the plan!" 

The gallery was a easy 2.1 km (1.3 mi) from the hotel, walking partly on _Las Ramblas_, perhaps Barcelona's most well-known boulevard for shopping, eating, playing, pick-poketing, and simply getting the feel for such an exciting city!
Barcelona--the EU's fifth most populous city and one of the largest on the Mediterranean. I highly recommend adding it to your Iberian travels!

### Picasso's homework

Picasso's most famous works are in the Louvre and the [Reina de Sofia Museum](https://www.museoreinasofia.es/en) in Madrid. But, the Barcelona collection captures many fine paintings in addition to a treasure trove of his sketch books and early work from when he lived in Barcelona. His early work resembles the sketches of Rembrandt or Rubens as he was trained in the classical style. Through some of his margin doodles, the observer might imagine the delopment of the modern styles of his later life. 

 The Pablo Picasso Museum in Barcelona is well worth an easy online reservation (in case it's busy) and a GPS-challenging trek into the Gothic Quarter. The streets are medieval-narrow, at times feeling like you can touch both sides while standing in the center of the _carrer_[^1]. (The GPS challenge comes from the observation that the phone GPS struggles to maintain a satellite signal in city canyons or narrow medieval streets. My GPS' compass pointer has at times spun around on the screen!)

Barcelona in the 'high season'  means 'crowded'--of course! Walking on the most popular streets and narrow pedestrian-only streets in the Gothic Quarter is challenging to a fast walker--like me. The crowds make it easy to slow my pace to a more harmonious spousal average! There were interesting stops along the way, including Placa Catalonia where we watched some of the Sunday Catalonian Socialist rally. Catalonians keep seeking an independent status--like the old days--even though the region has never existed independently from Spain. 

Even with the sites and somewhat direct path to the musem and back we managed to log `14,237` steps that first half day. Well, maybe:  I admit that the first day's  total included the morning's snaking through the lines for EU passport control and customs at the airport!

## Monday, May 12: Barcelona on foot

When the brochure "copy" in our formal tour pamphlet says that a city "was meant to be explored on foot" it can only mean that bus touring in traffic and then finding bus parking sucks! So, the first full day was marked by modest tour-bus rides to the main sights and then guided walking tours by knowledgeable local guides. Our first-day sights included:

- The Gothic Quarter
- The City Cathedral (exterior facades)
- Roman graves escavated during city construction
- The Gaudi houses
- Sagrada Familia 
- Placa Catalonia (with ever-present Catalonian Socialist rallies!)
- A panoramic bus tour of locations en route to Sagrada Familia

Clearly, we were kept on the move. I wonder, if had I relied on my 1980s era SLR camera, woudl most of my pictures be out of focus due to the lack of time in front of photogenic sites? No time to focus! Fortunately, modern smartphone cameras are ready to go--almost prefocused and framed for each shot. 

Our "best viewed on foot" tour of Barcelona logged `14,223` steps at a good pace through the best parts of the city.

### Antoni Gaudi: Barcelona's Architect

The Basilica de [Sagrada Familia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia) catholic church is a highly recognized and memorable landmark of Barcelona. In fact, the cathedral is often mistakenly called the _Cathedral of Barcelona_--which it is not. Rather, it is the dream project of the architect, [Antoni Gaudi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoni_Gaud%C3%AD) who was a visionary--perhaps eccentric--Spanish architect of the 19th century. Firsthand looks at his legacy works is a splendid reason _to go to Barcelona!_

Gaudi had three major passions that course through all of his work: architecture, nature, and God. The culmination of his weaving the three passions together is in the _Basilica de la Sagrada Familia_, started in 1882. Its targeted completion is 2026, but my firsthand observation is that 2026 is overly-optimistic! The church is a sanctioned project of the Catholic Church; however, it must be built on donations and voluneerism. That's why it is still under construction even after 143 years of work!

## On the road again
