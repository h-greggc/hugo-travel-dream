Barcelona is a vibrant city known for its rich history, stunning architecture, and lively culture. It is home to numerous world-class museums, including the Picasso Museum and the Joan Miró Foundation, showcasing the works of these renowned artists. The city's historic center, with its Gothic Quarter, features narrow medieval streets, charming squares, and impressive landmarks such as the Barcelona Cathedral and the Plaça del Rei.

## A Traveler's Rule: Don't Nap

Travelers arriving from the US are likely to take overnight flights to European destinations arriving on the morning of their first tour day. Tour guides tell you that napping away the remainder of the first day never hastens the adjustment to a new time-zone. Therefore, just drop your bags at the hotel and head right out for some local sites and sounds in the daylight! Jet lag will disappear. The location of our hotel, [H10 Casanova](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9KdhMajapr1dNEm86), is shown on the embedded Googlemap:

## Barcelona in the "high season"

Rebecca and I dropped off our luggage and laced our walking shoes for an afternoon of _unguided_ Barcelona. I had already secured reservations for the Pablo Picasso museum, so that was our target -- the answer to  "what's the plan?" 

Our target gallery was a easy 2.1km (1.3mi) from the hotel, walking partly on _La Rambla_, a.k.a. _Les Rambles_ and perhaps Barcelona's most well-known boulevard for shopping, eating, playing, pick-pocketing, and simply getting a feel for such an exciting city! Barcelona: the EU's fifth most populous city and one of the largest on the Mediterranean. 


### Picasso's homework

Picasso's most famous works are in the Louvre and the Reina de Sofia Museum in Madrid. But, the collection in Barcelona captures a treasure trove of his numerous sketch books and earlier paintings when he lived in Barcelona in the quarter encompassing today's museum. The Pablo Picasso Museum in Barcelona is well worth an easy online reservation (in case it's busy) and a GPS-challenging trek into the Gothic Quarter. The streets are medieval-narrow, at times feeling like you can touch both sides while standing in the center of the _carrer_[^1].

"Barcelona in the 'high season' translates to mean "crowded"--of course! Walking on the most popular streets and narrow pedestrian-only streets in the Gothic Quarter is challenging to a fast walker-like me. Nevertheless, we managed to log `14,237` steps that first half day. 

## Monday, May 12: Barcelona on foot

When the brochure "copy" in our formal tour pamphlet says that a city "was meant to be explored on foot" it can only mean that bus touring in traffic and then finding bus parking sucks! So, the first full day was marked by shortish tour-bus rides to the main sights and then guided walking tours by knowledgeable local guides. Our first-day sights included:

- The Gothic Quarter
- The City Cathedral (exterior facades)
- Roman graves escavated during city construction
- The Gaudi houses
- Sagrada Familia 
- Placa Catalonia (with ever-present Catalonian Socialist rallies!)
- A panoramic bus tour of locations en route to Sagrada Familia

Clearly, we were kept on the move. I wonder, had I needed to rely on my 1980s era SLR camera, would my pictures be out of focus due to the lack of time we had in front of photogenic sites: No time to focus! Fortunately, modern smartphone cameras are ready to go--almost prefocused and framed for each shot. Some of our fellow travelers would end up with several _thousand_ photos in search of the perfect chance shot! 

Our "best viewed on foot" tour of Barcelona logged `14,223` steps at a good pace through the best parts of the city.
### Antoni Gaudi: Barcelona's Architect

The Basilica de [Sagrada Familia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia) catholic church is a highly recognized and memorable landmark of Barcelona. In fact, the cathedral is often mistakenly called the _Cathedral of Barcelona_--which it is not. Rather, it is the dream project of the architect, [Antoni Gaudi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoni_Gaud%C3%AD) who was a visionary--perhaps eccentric--Spanish architect of the 19th century. Firsthand looks at his legacy works is a splendid reason _to go to Barcelona!_ The works include not only the Sagrada Familia, but also the _Gaudi Houses_[^2].

Gaudi had three major passions that course through all of his work: architecture, nature, and God. The culmination of his weaving the three passions together is in the Basilica de la Sagrada Familia, started in 1882. Its targeted completion is 2026, but my firsthand observation is that finishing in 2026 is an overly-optimistic goal! Although the church is a sanctioned project of the Catholic Church, it must be built on donations and volunteerism. That's why it is still under construction even after 143 years of work! Moreover, the rights to the surrounding areas have not been fully secured. For example, the doorways in the eastern facade are a dozen or more feet off the pavement--a sidewalk on busy side street. Presently, the only way to use the facade entrance is by ladder! Fortunately, the northern and southern porticos are open for business (LOL)! 


> _The surrealist artist, Salvador Dali, once commented that Gaudi possessed “superbly creative bad taste.” But far from a critic, Dali admired the architect and also said  “In Passeig de Gràcia you will find sensational examples of this type of delirious architecture, true solidified Debussian music![^3]_."

A major challenge for interested viewers face with a generations-long architectural  project is in bridging the gap between the construction to date and the completed, "visionary" work. For example, the cover picture for this story was downloaded (and attributed!) from a photographer who took the time to digitally erase the abundant overheal cranes and cables. Nevertheless, there is still some scaffolding remaining along a spire on the left. The incomplete construction atrifacts also challenge the "selfie" taker, as visible in the following image.

### Inside La Sagrada Familia 
The exterior facades of La Sagrada Familia are spectacular and they are of grand architectural scale. But the placement of almost excessive statuary and other adornments make the portals feel small and close as you enter the cathredral. This makes you unprepared for the architectural scale of the interior! Once inside, you are swept  toward the heavens by the high ceilings supported by sweeping and tapered modern columns--no staid, corinthian-topped columns in sight! The columns finish in their upper reaches with sweeping branch designs rather than by connections to gothic arches. No less than _SPECTACULAR!_
