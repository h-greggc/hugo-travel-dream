Toledo, located in Spain, is renowned for its historical and cultural significance and was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986. Since Spain’s administrative reorganization in 1978, the city has been part of the autonomous community of Castilla-La Mancha. Positioned on a rocky outcrop within a bend of the Tagus (Tajo) River—the longest river on the Iberian Peninsula—Toledo presents the appearance of an island fortress when viewed from nearby scenic routes. As the river continues into Portugal and passes through Lisbon, it is known as the Techa River.
