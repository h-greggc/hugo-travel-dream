Toledo is a city in Spain, known for its rich history and cultural heritage. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1986. The city is part of the autonomous community of Castilla-La Mancha since Spain was reorganized in 1978. The city is on a rock outcrop in a hairpin bend of the Tagus (_Tajo_ in Spanish) River, the longest river on the Iberian peninsula. The river becomes  known as the _Techa_ River as it flows into Portugal and through Lisbon on the way to the Atlantic. From nearby scenic roads the river gives Toledo the appearance of an island fortress.
