Granada, Spain, is the site of the Alhambra.  Alhambra is a palace and fortress complex that was originally built in 889 AD on the remains of a Roman fort. It was later renovated and rebuilt in the mid-13th century by the Nasrid emir Mohammed ben Al-Ahmar, the first king of the Nasrid dynasty. The Alhambra is renowned for its stunning Islamic architecture, intricate tile work, and beautiful gardens.
Restored beginning in the 19th century, Alhambra provides a lasting imprint of history of Muslim rulers in Adulusian Iberia.

### Famous residents

The Moors, who were Muslim rulers, constructed the Alhambra as a symbol of their power and culture. The palace complex was the last of the Moors' fortifications and seat of power on the Iberian peninsula. Construction was begun in 1238 by _Muhammad I Ibn al-Ahmar_, the founder of the emirate of Granada.[^1] Successive occupants built more buildings and eventually, the palace was fitted for King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella in 1492. Christopher Columbus received his commission in this location. The following panamorama shows how spread out the complex became over the ages!

including  complex includes several palaces, gardens, and fortifications, with the most famous being the Nasrid Palaces, which feature exquisite stucco work, carved wooden ceilings, and elaborate tile mosaics.

### Always time and space for reflection

It is important to reflect on God's wisdom and beauty. The Moorish architects designed many quiet relection spots throughout Alhambra's palaces. Some include water features, while others are thoughtfully designed gardens.
