## On the road!

We loaded the bus for our first significant bus ride--from Barcelona to Valencia via the coastal village of Peniscola. Peniscola is a coastal village "built on rock" in the Mediterranean Sea. It is in the Province of Castellón in the Autonomous Community of Valencia.

For Knights Templar fans, the castle at Peniscola was a one of their series of fortifications along southern Spain. The castle was finished by the Templars in 1307. In the centuries following, the castle changed hands several times, from Crown of Aragon to being the home of Pope Benedict XIII during the Avignon papacy (1309-1376).[^1] The castle has been preserved more recently and acquired extra walls partly due to the filming of _El Cid_ in Peniscola.[^2]  The movie portrays the 11th century mercenary hero, Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, who was elevated to national hero status due to the poem, _El Cid_.

Our travel day left us only enough time for a quick walking tour and seaside lunch. The quick walking tour of the rock was easy because "Valencia's Gibraltar" is very small! Lunch was a bit more challenging to accomplish during a brief visit due to Spain's preference for drawn out meals with plenty of table conversation. We joined another couple for seafood served above the Mediterranean. Rebecca enjoyed a poached cuttlefish, while I had a grilled, whole "sea bass." I was reminded that seemingly half of the world's bony and scaly fish are labeled "bass" out of convenience for the consumer. I believe that actually at a _bronzini_.or _branzano_ [^3]. This distinction is important to a sometimes striper fisherman!
