## City of Architecture, Culture, and a slight lisp... 

Valencia, the third-largest city in Spain, is a lively city having a lively youthful culture, rich modern and historic architecture, and serving as a boundary between Spanish languages. Valencia's _City of Arts and Sciences_ is a futuristic complex that housing a science museum, planetarium, aquarium, and performance halls. The city's historic center is a maze of narrow streets lined with Gothic and Baroque buildings, including the impressive Valencia Cathedral, which claims to house the Holy Grail.


### A bit of a lisp

I once heard a liguistics professor argue that Pittsburgh, PA's unique accent reflected the odd mix of cultures passing through the region: Scots English, Irish, Acadians, and Virginia English colonists, etc. Similarly, Valencia has both audible and visual mixings of Castilian and Catalan Spanish. (The Arabic influence seemed to have moved on while leaving some 3,000 Spanish words that begin with _Al-_.) The French-sounding Catalan is heard in the eastern side of Valencia, while the more "proper" Castilian language is in the west. The mix creates a curious lisp:  "Valens-thi-a"  instead of "Valens-see-a."  Close to the proposed language intersection in the city, the street signs credit both languages by posting streets as both  _carrers_ and  _calles_.  

>Based on my travels, regions or cities living multilingually or having multiple dialects are more tolerant of my amatuer attempts at their language. For example, Brazil--having a couple dozen Portuguese dialects--seem pleased at my attempted Portuguese. I reason that their tolerance for my odd language is derived from thinking, "oh well, he's just speaking another dialect I haven't heard before!"
