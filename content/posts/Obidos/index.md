### Tourists!
Óbidos is a picture-perfect tourist attraction! Óbidos is home to various festivals throughout the year, celebrating everything from chocolate to medieval history, making it a vibrant destination for tourists and history enthusiasts alike. As such, we arrived among a herd of tour buses whose loads of tourists spilled out to pack the narrow streets.

The only thing to spoil our photo views of the medieval, walled city was the number of tourists. The narrow streets make it difficult to get a good photo without someone in the way. Oh, well, I am sure that I was also a "selfy- or vista-bomber spoil some other tourist's favorite photo scene!

### The Walls and Castle of Óbidos    
The city is completely surrounded by a defensive wall upon which the brave tourist can walk. There is no railing on the inside of the ramparts, so one step backwards from the view and you might land 20-30 feet below! Rebecca and I avoided the wall, but here I borrow a photo from Randy Feldman, who walked the wall and took some great shots. The photo is at a particularly low and wide section of the wall, so it is not the most dangerous part of the wall.

### Cherry liqueur and chocolate at 9 AM? 

Óbidos is famous for its cherry liqueur, Ginjinha, which is sometimes served in small,  dark chocolate cups. Just inside the gate (at 9 AM) we stopped at a small window shop. Our guide, Carmen, said that this window shop served "the best Ginjinha in Obidos!" The owner smiled at me and said, "after all, we are the _first_ store once inside the city wall!"  The liqueur was moderately sweet and fruity, and the chocolate cup made the concoction a delicious "melt in the mouth" breakfast dessert!
