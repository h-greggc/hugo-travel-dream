The city is famous for its stunning architecture, including the Great Mosque of Córdoba, the Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos, and the Roman Bridge.

Cordoba is a city in southern, Andalusion Spain, known for its rich history and cultural heritage. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1984. The city is famous for inspiring architecture of the Roman and Moorish periods, including the Great Mosque of Córdoba, the Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos, and the Roman Bridge. It's often mistaken for a set from the "Game of Thrones" series; however, there were only two brief scenes were shot in the area. A more sustained use of ancient settings for the series included sites 5-15 miles from Cordoba.

## The Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba[^1] 

_La Mezquita_ or the "Great Mosque of Córdoba"  was a completely unexpected cultural and architectural treat. The mosque was built in stages beginning in 785 and eventually growing to be about 5.5 acres of floor space. (That rivals small-city some convention halls for floor space!} It is believed to have been constructed on the ruins of Roman ruins and Visigoth church; however, that early history is debated among scholars. There were several periods of construction of the mosque halls. A well-prepared tour guide will point out the subtle transitions in the columns and arches as a result of evolving deigns and the period's available materials. 

As you walk through the halls, the number of moorish arches is staggering ---each one in red and white alternating stripes which I have been told  recognizes good and evil in the world.

Our tour guides said that the "royals" and "cardinals" of the _La Reconquista_ period were recyclers: it is economical to repurpose key buildings rather than start over just to satisfy contemporary design aesthetics. Taken alone, the sudden transformation from a mosque to a gothic cathedral draws the viewer into searching for more subtleties of the architectural transition. I was left feeling that the Catholic builders were not overly concerned with an aesthetically organized  transitions from Islamic to Catholic traditions. There are Islamic single- and double-arches supporting gothic roofing arches and even Moorish arches on one side of a chapel while Gothic arches support the other side.
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque%E2%80%93Cathedral_of_C%C3%B3rdoba), the christians began using the mosque "as is" shortly after the _Reconquista_ and it was in the 1600s that the Catholic cathedral was built within the mosque's walls.

## Of Course, the Romans 

Surviving Roman artifacts most famously include the Roman Bridge as a entry to the southern gate of Cordoba. As a former resident of the Washington, DC, metro area, I can't help but notice the staying power of Roman bridge designs.  


## The Jewish Quarter

One major theme that one leaves with from Adalusian Spain with is the ubiquitous "Jewish Quarters" within the historic centers of cities. 



[^1]: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque%E2%80%93Cathedral_of_C%C3%B3rdoba) has an excellent short history on the Mosque-Cathedral.
