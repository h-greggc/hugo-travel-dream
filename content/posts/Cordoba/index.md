Cordoba is a city in southern, Andalusion Spain, known for its rich history and cultural heritage. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1984. The city is famous for stunning architecture of the Roman and Moorish periods, including the Great Mosque of Córdoba, the Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos, and the Roman Bridge. It's often mistaken for a set from the "Game of Thrones" series; however, there were only two brief themes were shot there. A more sustained use of ancient settings for the series included sites 5-15 miles from Cordoba--(close enyough!)

## The Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba 

_La Mezquita_ or the "Great Mosque of Córdoba"  was a completely unexpected cultural and visual treat. The mosque was in stages beginning in 785 it eventually grew to be about 5.5 acres of floor space. (That rivals small-city some convention halls for floor space!} It is believed to have been constructed on the ruins of a Visigoth church; however, that early history is debated among scholars. There were several periods of construction of the mosque halls. A prepared tour guide will point out the subtle transitions in the columns and arches as a result of evolving deigns and the period's available materials. 

As your walk through the halls, the number of moorish arches is mind-numbing---each one in red and white alternating stripes in recognition of good versus evil in the world under God.

Our tour guides said that the "royals" and "cardinal" of the _La Reconquista_ were recyclers: it was economical to repurpose key buildings rather than start over just to satisfy current design aesthetics. Nevertheless, the approaches to the cathedral in the interior space have some transitional designs such that the mosque-church boundary is not _too_ abrupt.
