This blog records some of my experiences on our recent [Collette](https://www.gocollette.com/en) tour of _The Spain Classics and Portugal_.[^1] I placed pins on the featured map (above) covering some of the cities and regions that we toured. The tour sometimes felt like drinking culture and sites from a firehose; however, the knowledgeable tour manager and local guides held our interest. It didn't hurt that we had gorgeous, bright-blue days and pleasant temps for the trip, including a 56 &#176;F morning in Madrid! 

The following table highlights the itinerary. Links to the stories are present (where possible.) The last column shows my recorded steps each day. The bus travel days were _only_ in the 8,000+ range. The lowest day reflected just hanging out in Lisbon!
