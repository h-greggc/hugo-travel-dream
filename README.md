# hugo-dream-travel 
This website theme was built on the `hugo-theme-dream` by [Yue Yang](https://github.com/g1eny0ung) at 
https://github.com/g1eny0ung/hugo-theme-dream. 

I have modified a few features including adding a simple shortcode to place two or more images side by side. Minor changes include implementing an email share link and a Google map shortcode.
